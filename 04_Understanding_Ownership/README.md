# Ownership in Rust:

* Ownership is a set of rule that governs how a rust program manages memory. 

* Rust uses memory management through a system of ownership with a set of rules that compiler checks. if any of the rules are violated, teh program won't compile.

* Rust ownership is new concept for many programmers, it does take some time to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you'll find it to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient.
